Printing the case really depends on your own printer but here are some basic
guidelines that you can adjust accordingly. The power supply for HVAC - US is
too high but because we use the same design for both US and EU models, you
would need to clip off one of the 3 LCD hooks. Facing the cover from the
outside, cut the bottom left hook. Doesn't need to be flush.

files (BaseONE*.stl and CoverONE*.stl).

\subsubsection{Filament}
Choose a filament that stays rigid enough in the max temperature your house may
reach on a hot Summer day without the AC on :)

We use nGen filament for this reason but also because it prints easily and
reliably.  Check the same \href{https://hestiapi.com/downloads/}{download} page
