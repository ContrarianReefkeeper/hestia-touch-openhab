\subsubsection{How to edit files via SSH}
If you are very new to command line interface we would advise you taking a
short online course by searching for ``linux command line interface'' on your
favourite website.

To edit a file while you are inside SSH use the command

\texttt{sudo nano /path/to/your/file}

Then leave your mouse alone as it does not control you cursor anymore

Use only your keyboard and once you are done, press Ctrl+O to save and Ctrl+X to close.

\subsubsection{Start OpenHAB2 in Debug Mode}

For OpenHAB2 (v10.x image -- July 2018)
To monitor the OpenHAB logs without stopping the service run

\texttt{openhab-cli showlogs}

To start OpenHAB manually after stopping the service run

\texttt{openhab-cli start}

For older OpenHAB installations:
Stop OpenHAB first

\texttt{sudo service openhab2 stop}

and when it is stopped, start it manually

\texttt{/usr/share/openhab2/start\_debug.sh}

once (if) loaded type inside the OpenHAB session

\texttt{log:tail}

and notice any issues.
